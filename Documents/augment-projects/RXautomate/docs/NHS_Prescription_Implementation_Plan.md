# NHS Prescription Handling Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation approach for NHS prescription handling in the RXautomate multi-tenant pharmacy system. The implementation will focus on automating UK pharmacy processes for NHS prescriptions, including eligibility checking, exemption verification, and patient engagement.

## Integration Points

### NHS Spine Connection
- **Primary Option**: Direct NHS Spine connection via N3/HSCN network
  - Requires proper network access and certificates
  - Formal NHS Digital approval process
  - Compliance with NHS IG Toolkit standards

### Alternative Integration Approach
- **Middleware Integration**: Connect to existing pharmacy systems
  - Integration with RxWeb, PharmOutcomes, or other pharmacy management systems
  - Use of existing connections to NHS Spine where available
  - Potential for faster implementation timeline

## Core Functions

### Automated Eligibility Checking
- Integration with NHS BSA database for real-time eligibility verification
- Implementation of the `verifyEligibility` method in `NHSSpineService`
- Caching mechanism for frequently accessed eligibility data
- Audit logging for all eligibility checks

### Exemption Status Verification
- Automated checking of patient exemption status
- Alert system for expired or soon-to-expire exemptions
- Integration with NHS exemption database
- Enhancement of the existing `checkExemptionStatus` method

### SMS Reminder System
- Implementation of prescription readiness notifications
- Collection reminders with configurable timing
- Integration with NHS Notify API for compliant messaging
- Opt-in/opt-out management for GDPR compliance

## Technical Requirements

### NHS Digital API Authentication
- Secure storage of NHS API credentials
- Implementation of OAuth 2.0 flow for NHS Digital APIs
- Regular rotation of credentials
- Monitoring of authentication failures

### Secure Data Handling
- Compliance with NHS IG Toolkit requirements
- End-to-end encryption for all patient data
- Data minimization principles in API requests
- Proper audit trails for all data access

### SMS Gateway Integration
- Integration with SMS providers compatible with NHS standards
- Templated messages for consistency
- Delivery receipts and failure handling
- Rate limiting to prevent message flooding

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Set up secure NHS API connections
2. Implement basic patient lookup functionality
3. Create database schema for prescription tracking
4. Establish secure authentication mechanisms

### Phase 2: Eligibility & Exemption Checking
1. Implement eligibility verification API
2. Build exemption status checking
3. Create admin interface for manual verification
4. Develop reporting for eligibility/exemption issues

### Phase 3: Prescription Processing
1. Implement prescription receipt workflow
2. Build dispensing process with safety checks
3. Create collection tracking system
4. Implement prescription status updates

### Phase 4: Patient Communication
1. Implement SMS notification system
2. Create patient communication preferences
3. Build reminder scheduling system
4. Develop communication audit trails

## Integration with Existing RXautomate Components

### NHSSpineService Enhancement
- Expand the existing service with additional API endpoints
- Implement robust error handling and retry logic
- Add caching layer for performance optimization
- Implement comprehensive logging

### EPSService Integration
- Connect with Electronic Prescription Service
- Implement prescription download functionality
- Build prescription update capabilities
- Create prescription search functionality

### NotifyService Extension
- Enhance SMS capabilities for prescription notifications
- Implement templated messages for different scenarios
- Add scheduling capabilities for reminders
- Create analytics for message effectiveness

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Implementation of role-based access controls
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits
- Compliance with NHS Data Security and Protection Toolkit

### Audit Trail
- Comprehensive logging of all prescription activities
- User action tracking
- System change monitoring
- Regular audit reports

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test all API integrations with mock services
- Validate data transformation logic
- Test error handling scenarios
- Verify security implementations

### Integration Testing
- Test end-to-end prescription workflows
- Verify integration with NHS systems using test environments
- Validate multi-tenant isolation
- Test performance under load

### User Acceptance Testing
- Pharmacy staff workflow validation
- Patient communication testing
- Administrative function verification
- Reporting accuracy confirmation

## Deployment Strategy

### Staging Environment
- Deploy to NHS test environments first
- Validate all integrations in a controlled setting
- Perform security assessments
- Conduct performance testing

### Production Rollout
- Phased deployment to production
- Initial deployment to limited pharmacies
- Monitoring and feedback collection
- Gradual expansion to all tenants

## Maintenance and Support

### Monitoring
- Real-time monitoring of NHS API connections
- Alert system for integration failures
- Performance monitoring
- Usage analytics

### Updates
- Regular updates to maintain NHS compliance
- Feature enhancements based on feedback
- Security patches
- Performance optimizations

## Conclusion
This implementation plan provides a comprehensive approach to integrating NHS prescription handling into the RXautomate system. By following this structured approach, we can ensure a secure, compliant, and efficient implementation that meets the needs of UK pharmacies and their patients.
